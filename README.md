# Omegl-AI

To make the script work, you must place your 'API key' in the creation of the 'openAI' attribute on line 28. For example:
private OpenAIApi openAI = new OpenAIApi('XX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX');
    
The askPrompt attribute should store the questions and answers, using 'Q:' for the question and 'A:' for the answer, both separated by a line break using '\n'.
 
----- WEBGL ISSUE -----

Due to OpenAI's CORS image storage policy, the profile picture generated by Dall-E cannot be downloaded properly in the web version, so the "profile picture" cannot be seen. Please download the PC version to enjoy a complete experience.
