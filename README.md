To make the script work, you must place your 'API key' in the creation of the 'openAI' attribute on line 28. For example:
//ENTER YOUR API KEY HERE:
    private OpenAIApi openAI = new OpenAIApi('XX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX');

Due to OpenAI's CORS image storage policy, the profile picture generated by Dall-E cannot be downloaded properly in the web version, so the "profile picture" cannot be seen. Please download the PC version to enjoy a complete experience.
